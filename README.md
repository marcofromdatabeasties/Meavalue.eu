# Meavalue.eu
Enhance your competence with the things you make while working.

This is the main program of Meavalue.eu. We are a non-profit (Stichting) that enables working people to increase their knowledge, skills and professional attitudes. This is seen as by the EU as competence. The basis for the program is a PhD research by Marco Dumont. Feel free to contribute in any form. Just let us know.
